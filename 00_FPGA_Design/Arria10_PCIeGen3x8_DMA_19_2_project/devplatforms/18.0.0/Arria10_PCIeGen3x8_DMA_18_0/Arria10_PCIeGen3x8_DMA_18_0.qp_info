It transfers data either between on- chip memory and system memory or external memory and system memory. The reference design includes Linux software drivers that set up the DMA transfer. You can also use the software driver to measure and display the performance achieved for the transfers. This reference design allows you to evaluate the performance of the PCI Express protocol in using the Avalon-MM interface. </description><documentation><title>AN 829: PCI Express Avalon -MM DMA Reference Design</title><url>https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/documentation/ecx1522703736467.html</url></documentation></platform>
