# This SDC is used to constrain a design containing logic driven by JTAG that is missing a clocking
# constraint on altera_reserved_tck. This SDC will add a default constraint if none is present, and 
# there are is at least one clock defined in the design.  We don't want to constrain altera_reserved_tck
# when there are no defined clocks since altera_reserved_tck will then become the highest priority clock.
# This will affect the place and route result of logic driven by other clocks in the design.
